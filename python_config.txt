option_settings:

This section is used to set custom configuration options for the Elastic Beanstalk environment.
Each environment option has a specific namespace (e.g., aws:elasticbeanstalk:container:python) and key-value pairs to define settings.

aws:elasticbeanstalk:container:python:

This is the namespace for settings related to the Python container on Elastic Beanstalk.
It includes various configuration options specifically for Python-based applications, such as the WSGIPath.

here,
    WSGIPath: application:application
    WSGIPath: <module>:<callable>

  ->application (first part): the name of the Python module where your WSGI 
    application is located. In your case, it indicates the file application.py.

  ->application (second part): the callable object (typically a function or variable) 
    that represents the WSGI application instance. Here, application is expected to be the 
    variable or function in application.py that creates and returns the WSGI app (often an instance of a Flask or Django app).

->application=Flask(__name__)

->app=application

#Route for a home page

->@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

so it mentions the entry part of the app
